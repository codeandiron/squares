1. Navigate to the root level of the project (with the pom.xml)
2. Set your CLASSPATH to the src directory for the java files: i.e. "export CLASSPATH=/home/coder/workspace/wishabi/src/main/java"
3. Set your JAVA_HOME: i.e. "export JAVA_HOME=/usr/java/jdk1.7.0_03"
4. Ensure that your user has permission to execute the build and clean scripts ("sudo chmod u+x build")
5. Executing ./build will build all 3 projects, ./clean will remove all non-source files.

Texture Packing Question=======================================
1. Run the demo of the "texture packing" by typing appletviewer src/main/java/applet.html 
2. Try resizing the window to see the squares re-placed in the frame. 
3. It will display "Too Small!" if it can't fit the squares.
4. Pretty neat problem. There are some interesting heuristic algorithms for this available online, 
but apparently the space savings can be tiny for a massive increase in complexity.
